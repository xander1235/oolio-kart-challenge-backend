# Advanced Challenge

Build an API server implementing our OpenAPI spec for food ordering API in [Go](https://go.dev).\
You can find our [API Documentation](https://orderfoodonline.deno.dev/public/openapi.html) here.

API documentation is based on [OpenAPI3.1](https://swagger.io/specification/v3/) specification.
You can also find spec file [here](https://orderfoodonline.deno.dev/public/openapi.yaml).

> The API immplementation example available to you at orderfoodonline.deno.dev/api is simplified and doesn't handle some edge cases intentionally.
> Use your best judgement to build a Robust API server.

## Basic Requirements

- Implement all APIs described in the OpenAPI specification
- Conform to the OpenAPI specification as close to as possible
- Implement all features our [demo API server](https://orderfoodonline.deno.dev) has implemented
- Validate promo code according to promo code validation logic described below

### Promo Code Validation

You will find three big files containing random text in this repositotory.\
A promo code is valid if the following rules apply:

1. Must be a string of length between 8 and 10 characters
2. It can be found in **at least two** files

> Files containing valid coupons are couponbase1.gz, couponbase2.gz and couponbase3.gz

You can download the files from here

[file 1](https://orderfoodonline-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/couponbase1.gz)
[file 2](https://orderfoodonline-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/couponbase2.gz)
[file 3](https://orderfoodonline-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/couponbase3.gz)

**Example Promo Codes**

Valid promo codes
